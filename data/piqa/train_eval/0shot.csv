Goal: Is genetically modifying DNA the same as what breeders and horiculturalists have been doing for centuries?
0: Genetically modifying an organism is no different than what horticulturalists and breeders have been doing for centuries.

The DNA of an organism has a protection against being modified by another invading organism, so the introduction of another specie's genetic material must be forced and is a crude unpredictable process at the current time. There is no prediction of what such disruptions will cause in future generations of the organism that reproduces with compromised DNA.

Goal: make breakfast popcicles
0: 6 tbsp oats use gluten free if required    360 ml (1.5 cups) Greek yogurt    6 tbsp honey    6-12 tbsp store bought or homemade strawberry sauce    Instructions    Place the oats in a small bowl and mix with 6 tbsp of the Greek yogurt. Put to one side.    Place 2 tbsp of Greek yogurt in each of the popsicles sticks. Give them a tap until the yogurt sinks to the bottom.        Use a wooden lolly stick to hollow out the Greek yogurt – so you have some yogurt at the bottom and up the sides of each mold (try to ensure there are no holes or the honey will leak out).    Carefully pour 1 tbsp of honey into the hollow in each mold. Make sure none of the honey is touching the sides of the popsicle mold.    Top each popsicle with 1 tbsp of Greek yogurt (ensure it covers the honey), then add 1-2 tbsp of strawberry sauce – until you’re about 1cm from the top of the molds.    Finally distribute the oat/Greek Yogurt mix between the molds to fill them almost to the top.    Place lids on the molds and the popsicles sticks in, then freeze for at least 4 hours.    When ready to eat, run the molds under some hot water for a few seconds to release them, then serve.
