Goal: How do you clean an aquarium filter?
0: It is important to protect the beneficial bacteria in the aquarium's filter, because this is what will process the toxins from fish waste, harmful ammonia and nitrite, into the far less toxic nitrate. To protect this bacteria while cleaning the filter, do not throw away used filter pads until they are absolutely falling apart. Instead, swish them around in a little dechlorinated water to remove any dirt and debris, and put them back.

Goal: To make Belgian waffles
0: In a large bowl, stir together two tablespoons of self rising flour, 3/4 cup white sugar, and 3 3/4 teaspoons baking powder with a balloon whisk. Separate two eggs by cracking the shells on a flat surface, gently prying the broken shells apart, letting the whites slide through your fingers into one bowl while holding the unbroken yolks in your hand, to place in another bowl. Beat the yellow egg yolks together with a whisk, and add 1 1/2 cups milk, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract and 1 cup melted butter. Whisk. Add the wet mixture into the dry mixture and whisk again. Use a stand mixer with the whisk attachment fitted to whisk the whites until they hold firm peaks, standing straight up when you remove the whisk. Using a silicone spatula, gently fold the egg whites into the flour mixture by placing one spoonful of egg whites at a time into the bowl, lifting some of the mixture over the whites and repeating this gently until the whites are completely mixed in and the mixture is light and fluffy. Take great care not to 'crunch' the mixture, pushing out air.

Goal: Make the best tasting lemonade you've ever tried.
0: Only use fresh lemons, a dozen for a 2 litre pitcher is perfect. Use only filtered water, no chlorine etc. Using a lemon squeezer or juicer, extract the fresh juice and pour into your 2 litre pitcher along with your favorite sweetener to taste, and fill with pure water. The water is what makes this lemonade taste so good. No after taste or chemical flavours to spoil it.
1: Lemonade can be made using vinegar and sugar, if you run out of lemons. With enough sugar you can't really taste the difference. It might need some yellow food colouring to make it look ""lemony"", which is quite important because the visual impact of food can rival the impact of the taste of the food itself.

Goal: Is there a best way to blow up party balloons?

Give each one a handful, depending on how many you need, and then return to the kitchen to continue getting food ready.

1: Invite 10 or 12 kids over half an hour before the party starts. With them watching, blow up a couple of balloons but tell the kids  they aren't allowed to touch them. Then, leave a box of pins on the table and say ""and don't touch these either"" very clearly. Leave the room until you hear the popping sounds.  When you come back in, tell them if they want balloons at the party they're the ones who have to blow them up. You'll have a roomful in about 10 minutes flat.

Let cool, then transfer to a sealed container and refrigerate until ready to use. Clarified butter should keep for at least 6 months in the refrigerator.
