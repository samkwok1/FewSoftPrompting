Goal: How to make the best porridge?
0: Porridge is basically horse food but cooked. Unless you are a 4 legged creature, there are lots of better choices out there for breakfast.
1: Porridge is easy on the pocketbook, and easy to prepare. Just boil the water and measure the oats in, add a little salt according to the directions on the box. Different types of oats require different cooking times. Simply let the water/oats come to a boil then turn down the heat and simmer till it thickens. A couple minutes and you're done. Stir often so it doesn't stick to the pot. The toppings are really what make porridge so delicious. Try raspberries and pistachios, or whipped  cream and bananas. Or try cinnamon and brown sugar and a pat of butter. What could taste better than that?

Use sharp blades since this will save a lot of your energy. The blades become blunt easily because of the strong backing of the tiles.

0: Ich is the most common fish illness in the freshwater aquarium hobby. Luckily, it is pretty easy to treat. The first step is positively identifying the parasitic infection. The infection looks like grains of white sand or salt all over the fishes fins, gills and eventually scales. The finnage may also appear tattered, and the fish may display flashing behavior, which looks like it is scratching its body on the substrate or ornaments to itch a scratch. Eventually, without treatment, as the infection progresses, the parasites attach themselves to the gills and the fish will settle at the bottom gasping, and eventually expire.
